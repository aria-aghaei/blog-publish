	      	One day I, an extremely wise and intelligent person, had a glorious idea and created this amazing website in like 30 minutes. It only took me half an hour to make this website because I have the power of theft. Did you know that taking open-source code is easy and you can basically do it whenever you want? 
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      	To pull this off you will need:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Basic command line skills
			</li>
			<li>
				Bare minimum git skill	
			</li>
			<li>
				HTML and CSS skill (maybe, or you can just wing it)
			</li>
			<li>
				That's pretty much it
			</li>
		</ul>
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      	The steps to making a good website are simple. First, git clone <a href="https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura">this repo</a> and then just take the example page and css file and edit it to your liking. Then, cd into the website directory and do this:</p>
	      <pre>
$ npm install http-server -g
$ http-server</pre>
	      <p>
	      	You can now browse to your website. Just type <code>localhost:8080</code> into your browser's address box. However, the website can only be accessed by you, on your local machine! How can you share your amazing and beautiful website with the earth and those dying to hear your thoughts? You have several options...

	      	<h3> The Simple, Free Way </h3>
		...Is to host on a free online host, i.e. someplace like neocities or github/gitlab pages. I will show you how to pull off hosting on github pages, but be warned, this is one of the most complex operations a human can preform and one wrong move can brick your computer and also blow it up and you might die.
